# Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters.
# The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. 
# The second should be the discount percentage as an integer. 
# The function should return the price of the item after the discount
#  has been applied. For example, if the price is 100 and 
# the discount is 10, the function should return 90.

# Example Inputs: full_price = 100, discount = 10
# Example Output: 90

def solution(full_price, discount):
  
    discount_to_apply = full_price * discount / 100
    return full_price - discount_to_apply
